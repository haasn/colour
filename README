I hope for this library to become the standard colour library for Haskell.
Most software does not properly blend colours because they fail to
gamma-correct the colours before blending.  Hopefully by using this library,
Haskell programs dealing with colour blending will avoid this problem.

I am making an early release of my colour library to get some feedback.
I am especially interested in getting feedback on the interfaces: should
functions be renamed, should functions be moved, etc.

Bug reports and any patches are also welcome.  Be warned, I haven't
extensively tested this library yet.
